## DM
Dense Matching

1.Mainly accomplished four dense matching methods, SAD, BM, DP, and SGBM.

2.The images are placed in the cpp directory, and the intensive matching of the different methods is accomplished by entering parameters in the debug window.

3.The outputs are in the cpp directory.

## TIN2DEM
TIN Interpolation to Generate DEM

1.triangle.h and point.h are the corresponding header files, and the main function is in main.cpp.

2.The TIN triangular grid files (.xyztri) are placed in the cpp directory and the output is also in the cpp directory.

3.DEM products with different grid spacing can be obtained by entering parameters in the debug window.
